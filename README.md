# MCCTexturePackPatcher
Patcher for modifications to  Halo: The Master Chief Collection's texture pack files

Created thanks to [Lord Zedd's Texture Pack Dumper](https://github.com/Lord-Zedd/MCCTexturePackDumper)

## Use

### For users

Double click on the executable and it will patch the files inside of your game install directory folders "data\ui\texturepacks". It will also create backups as neccessary so you can revert back to an unmodified state.

### For mod creators

If you're seeking to use this to install your own texture files, you will likely want the aforementioned Texture Pack Dumper by Lord Zedd as files are required to be of the same file size, type and dimensions of the originals in order to properly work in-game. Once you have found the textures you wish to edit, use the \_fileindex.txt generated by the patcher to find what DDS format it needs to be saved in. 

Now, alongside the Patcher's executable you will need to create a folder named "Files". In here you must place all of your edited DDS textures with their original file names, alongisde a texturepacks.txt which must contain the names of the texture packs your files are from, and a txt file with each texture pack name you want to have modified followed by "\_filelist", for example "levelstexturepack_filelist.txt" which contains the names of each texture you have modified, without the file extension and seperated by a space.
